I am a postdoctoral researcher at mathematical science department, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).

Eureka moment. That has been my core motivation for studying mathematics until now: I have occasionally encountered eureka moments while researching to identify unknown solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) from known data. Accordingly, my research topics are: 1) machine learning methodology for fast and general-purpose PDE solvers; and 2) the mathematical modeling and simulation of ocean wave dynamics. For more details, refer to my [CV](https://cjunho.github.io/junho/files/CV_choi2025.pdf) and [research statement](https://cjunho.github.io/junho/files/research_statement.pdf) 

Machine learning methodology for fast and general-purpose PDE solvers
======
My first research topic is dedicated to developing unsupervised operator learning networks for generating the rapid and accurate solution of parametric PDEs, including the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. Once trained by the structure of a target PDE, rather than by reference solutions to the PDE, the operator learning networks are capable of assigning the corresponding solutions to given PDE data in nearly real-time. Accordingly, this capability is useful for generating massive datasets to train physical artificial intelligences within a digital twin environment. Furthermore, this framework allows for real-time ensemble computing across various scenarios, enabling efficient, probabilistic forecasting in weather and climate modeling. 


The mathematical modeling and simulation of extreme ocean-wave dynamics 
======
The second topic involves the mathematical modeling and simulation of ocean wave dynamics, specifically focusing on highly non-linear phenomena like rogue waves. Building upon the Euler equations, I have introduced approximate PDE hierarchy and performed simulations using the approximate PDEs to realize rogue wave dynamics. This computational work is expected to serves as a key clue for justifying the relations among ocean wave models, and constructing robust, real-time forecasting and warning systems.



<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](https://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.  -->
